Clipster should allow live transcription (using whisper) and clipping (of selected transcription parts) of a youtube live video (the format of a live youtube video is https://www.youtube.com/live/Pc05XrvM1Ag)

We should not use youtube api, only alternate methods.

Take into account that working on a live youtube video have a lot of constraints. For example, the downloading of the video never ends as it’s a live video, so we can’t wait for the full video to be downloaded to work on it (transcription and clipping). You should set up a strategy that will allow you to extract audio, transcribe, and clip portions of the still downloading video (for example, create a copy of the currently downloading file, fix it with ffmpeg and then work on it).

Everything should happen real time, the idea is that this tool would allow anyone to be the first to clip a live video (so he can post it on social media). 

1. Project Goals
Real-Time Transcription of a YouTube Live Stream

Capture a live YouTube video’s audio in near real time (e.g., via yt-dlp, direct HLS, or a Chrome extension that intercepts media).
Transcribe with Whisper (or another STT system) as quickly as possible.
Instant Clip Creation

Let users highlight transcript segments and produce a corresponding video clip (with audio and video) from the still-downloading live stream.
No Official YouTube API

Work around official APIs or tokens. Instead, rely on direct media access from the page (Chrome extension scenario) or from yt-dlp/HLS (web app scenario).
Highly Responsive Pipeline

The entire chain—download -> chunk -> fix -> transcribe -> display -> clip—should be as close to real-time as possible, so the user can post clips almost immediately.
2. Use Cases and User Flows
2.1 Primary User Flow
User Enters Live URL

Paste a YouTube live link into the Clipster UI (web or extension popup).
System Begins Download

In the background, the system starts continuously downloading audio/video segments (e.g., live_download.ts).
Transcription Appears

Within seconds, partial transcripts begin appearing in the Clipster UI, with timestamps.
User Highlights Text

The user sees a funny or critical moment in the transcript and selects text from, say, 00:30.00 - 00:45.00.
“Create Clip”

The user clicks a button to generate a clip from that 15-second snippet.
The backend uses ffmpeg to cut from the local partial file, returning an .mp4 or .webm.
Clip Delivery

The user immediately gets a download link or a quick preview.
They can share it on social media without waiting for the stream to end.
2.2 Additional Scenarios
Stream Pauses or Ends: If the live stream stops, the system should gracefully handle the final segments and finalize transcript.
Multiple Clips: A user might create several clips during a single session, so the system must handle repeated clipping requests.
Multiple Languages: If the stream changes languages or the user wants to handle language detection, Whisper can do so, but you may incorporate auto-detection or allow user selection.
3. Architecture & Components
Here is a recommended architecture with the major components and their responsibilities:

Front-End / UI

Input for Live Stream: (URL or auto-detected in a Chrome extension).
Transcript Display: Real-time text, color-coded for new lines.
Clipping Panel: UI for selecting transcript ranges (or timestamps) and requesting clips.
Downloader / Ingestion Service

Grabs the live stream.
Writes to a rolling file or a sequence of chunked .ts files (using yt-dlp, ffmpeg, or direct M3U8 requests).
This file is indefinitely growing as the stream continues.
File Fixation / Segment Manager

Periodically duplicates or segments the rolling file so it’s “fixed” with valid headers.
This is essential because ffmpeg and Whisper need a proper container/metadata to process partial files.
Audio Extraction & Transcription

Repeatedly extracts the latest “fixed” portion’s audio.
Runs it through Whisper to generate partial transcripts with timestamps.
Aggregates transcripts (merging or de-duplicating overlapping segments).
Realtime Data Flow

The transcription results are sent to the front-end (via WebSockets, server-sent events, or extension messaging), so the user sees text quickly.
Clipping Engine

When a user selects a time range, an ffmpeg command is applied to the partial file(s) to produce a short clip.
The engine returns a path or URL for the user’s resulting clip.
4. Detailed Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
4.1 Setup & Dependencies
Core Tools

ffmpeg for demuxing, transcoding, and clipping.
yt-dlp (or an HLS approach) for continuous stream download.
OpenAI Whisper (Python) for speech-to-text.
Node.js (or Python) for the server back-end if doing a web app.
Chrome Extension scaffolding if building a purely extension-based solution.
Directory Structure (Example)

scss
Copier le code
clipster/
  ├─ backend/
  │   ├─ downloader.js (or .py)
  │   ├─ segment_manager.js
  │   ├─ transcription_worker.py
  │   ├─ clip_service.js
  │   ├─ server.js
  ├─ frontend/
  │   ├─ index.html
  │   ├─ main.js
  │   ├─ styles.css
  ├─ temp/ (temporary storage for partial files, snapshots, transcripts, etc.)
  ├─ README.md
  └─ package.json (if Node-based)
Environment Configuration
Ensure ffmpeg and yt-dlp are in $PATH.
Python environment with pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git for transcription.
For Node-based servers: npm install express socket.io.
4.2 Continuous Download or Streaming
Identify Live Stream URL

For a Chrome extension, parse the page DOM or network requests to find the M3U8 or dash manifest URL.
For a standalone web app, let the user paste the YouTube URL. Then call yt-dlp with --live-from-start (or similar) to read the stream in real time.
Start Download

Example command:
bash
Copier le code
yt-dlp "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIVE_ID" \
  --output "temp/live_download.%(ext)s" \
  --no-part
This writes a file like temp/live_download.ts that grows as the stream continues.
Segmented Download (Optional)

In place of a single .ts, you might instruct ffmpeg or yt-dlp to produce short segments (e.g., 10-second .ts slices). This can reduce overhead in “fixing” the entire file each time.
4.3 File Fixation & Segmentation Strategy
Regular Snapshots

Every X seconds (configurable: 5, 10, or 15), copy the partial file into a “fixed” version:
bash
Copier le code
ffmpeg -i temp/live_download.ts -c copy -y temp/fixed_current.ts
This ensures that metadata is present up to the last known keyframe.
Chunk-based Approach (Alternative)

If you generated chunk1.ts, chunk2.ts, etc., you can process each chunk as it arrives.
Each chunk is presumably already self-contained with valid headers.
File Rotation (Optional)

Manage old snapshots if disk space is limited (delete older snapshots after a certain number or time).
4.4 Audio Extraction & Whisper Transcription
Audio Extraction

Convert the “fixed” file to a suitable audio format for Whisper:
bash
Copier le code
ffmpeg -i temp/fixed_current.ts \
  -ar 16000 -ac 1 -f wav temp/audio_current.wav \
  -y
The 16 kHz mono WAV is commonly recommended for speech recognition tasks.
Whisper Invocation

Example (Python):
python
Copier le code
import subprocess

subprocess.run([
  'whisper', 'temp/audio_current.wav',
  '--model', 'base',
  '--language', 'en',
  '--output_dir', 'temp/'
])
Whisper outputs text, SRT, or JSON with timestamps. Choose a stable format (e.g., JSON or SRT) for easier parsing.
Transcript Aggregation

Parse the new transcripts, which might cover time T1 to T2 in the live video.

Maintain an in-memory or database structure, e.g.,

json
Copier le code
[
  {
    "start_sec": 30.00,
    "end_sec": 35.00,
    "text": "Hello everyone!"
  },
  ...
]
De-duplicate any previously processed segments. A straightforward approach:

Keep track of the “latest processed timestamp” in your aggregator.
If new transcript lines have start_sec < latest_processed, ignore them.
Frequency of Transcription Calls

Balance frequent short segments (faster updates but more overhead) vs. larger less frequent segments (slower updates but less overhead).
Example: every 10 seconds, fix the file, extract audio, transcribe, update UI.
4.5 Real-time Transcript Delivery to UI
WebSocket or Polling

A Node.js server can emit real-time events:
js
Copier le code
io.emit("transcript_update", {
  newLines: [...],
  lastProcessedTime: ...
});
The front-end listens and appends new lines to the on-screen transcript.
Chrome Extension Messaging

If building an extension, you can use chrome.runtime.sendMessage or a background script that updates a popup UI.
Alternatively, a local or remote server + WebSocket remains feasible.
UI Features

Show each new transcript line with its timestamp.
Highlight new text for a few seconds so the user notices real-time updates.
Possibly show a timeline or scroller for large volumes of text in long events.
4.6 Clipping Service
User Interaction

The user highlights lines or sets start/end timestamps. For example:
Start: 00:30.00
End: 00:45.00
Backend Clipping Request

The front-end sends an HTTP or WebSocket request to the server:
json
Copier le code
{
  "action": "create_clip",
  "start": 30.0,
  "end": 45.0
}
Locating the Relevant File(s)

If using one rolling snapshot approach, the clip is likely in the “temp/fixed_current.ts” or a slightly older file.
If using chunk-based approach, you must identify which chunk(s) cover [30.0, 45.0].
FFmpeg Trim Command

A typical ffmpeg trim to copy without re-encoding:
bash
Copier le code
ffmpeg -ss 30.0 -to 45.0 \
  -i temp/fixed_current.ts \
  -c copy temp/clip_1674023451.mp4
Name the file with a timestamp or unique ID to avoid collisions.
Return / Download

The server responds with a path/URL. The front-end prompts the user to download or preview the clip.
4.7 Continuous Operation
Looping
The ingestion, fixation, transcription, and UI updates run indefinitely while the live stream is ongoing.
Ending
If the stream ends or the user stops, the system can finalize the last segment, produce any final transcripts, and close.
5. Advanced Considerations
Latency vs. Quality

Latency Tuning: The smaller (and more frequent) the segments you fix/transcribe, the lower the delay before new text appears. However, frequent chunking can be CPU-intensive.
Transcription Quality: Larger context windows in Whisper can improve recognition of incomplete words or short phrases. But that may require buffering more audio.
Handling Overlaps

If your “fixed_current.ts” is re-generated every 10 seconds, it might contain repeated segments from 0-10s, 0-20s, etc. Your aggregator should keep track of what timestamps have already been processed.
Multiple Streams / Scalability

If multiple users are transcribing different streams concurrently, each user might spin up its own ingestion + transcription pipeline.
Consider containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate resources.
Whisper can be GPU-accelerated for better performance.
Speech Detection vs. Full Transcription

If you only want highlighted moments, you could skip text that is below a certain volume threshold or set a VAD (Voice Activity Detection). This can reduce transcription load.
Error Handling

If the live stream goes offline or the file is corrupted, your fixation steps might fail. Retry after a delay.
If ffmpeg fails due to missing keyframes, you might need a different trim approach (decode + re-encode). But that’s slower.
Chrome Extension Security

If building a Chrome extension that intercepts or manipulates the YouTube page’s media requests, ensure you handle extension permissions properly (<all_urls> or domain whitelisting).
The extension might also use the DevTools protocol to capture network HLS segments directly.
Automated Deployment

For a web app, containerize your Node + Python environment with Docker.
Provide environment variables for the path to ffmpeg, yt-dlp, etc.
Localization & Multi-lingual

Whisper supports many languages, but you might let users pick or do language detection automatically.
Timestamps from multiple languages might need separate alignment or segmentation.

8. Testing, Debugging, and Iteration
Local Testing

Spin up the Node server locally (node server.js).
Provide a test live URL or a recorded video for debugging.
Confirm transcripts appear in the console or UI.
Latency Tuning

If transcripts arrive too slowly, reduce the interval for fixation + transcription.
Watch CPU usage and memory usage; frequent calls might be expensive.
Edge Cases

Very short live streams that end quickly: ensure the pipeline cleans up gracefully.
No audio or silent segments: Whisper might produce empty transcripts, handle gracefully.
Overlapping or repeated segments due to reprocessing the same partial data: deduplicate by timestamp.
Iteration

Adjust chunk size, intervals, or concurrency as you gather performance data.
Possibly adopt streaming audio to Whisper for near-instant results (advanced approach).
9. Summary
By following these improved specifications, a development team—or an LLM working step-by-step—can build Clipster in a structured manner. The core ideas are:

Continual Download (partial or chunked).
Periodic “Fixation” with ffmpeg to ensure a valid container.
Audio Extraction -> Whisper Transcription -> UI Update in near real time.
Timestamp-based Clipping with minimal re-encoding overhead.
The final result is a responsive application (web or Chrome extension) that enables users to be the first to transcribe and share highlights from any YouTube live video—without relying on the official YouTube Data API.


You will work step by step : 

Step 1: Project Initialization & Basic File Structure
Create a new project folder (e.g., clipster).
Initialize a Node.js project (if using Node) or outline a Python folder structure.
For Node: npm init -y
For Python: create a virtual environment, plus a requirements.txt.
Create subfolders:
backend/ (for server logic)
frontend/ (for HTML/JS/CSS)
temp/ (for downloads, fixed files, transcripts)
Add empty starter files:
backend/server.js (or server.py)
backend/downloader.js (or .py)
frontend/index.html and frontend/main.js.
Goal: Have a minimal folder structure and a basic package definition ready for future steps.

Step 2: Implement Basic “Hello World” Server
In server.js (or server.py), set up a simple web server (Express or Flask) that listens on a specific port (e.g., 3000).
Create a root endpoint (/) that responds with “Hello from Clipster!” or similar confirmation.
Verify you can start the server and visit the endpoint in a browser.
Goal: Confirm that the development environment is working and you can serve basic responses.

Step 3: Add Continuous Download Logic
Install or specify usage of yt-dlp (or direct HLS approach).
In downloader.js (or .py), create a function that:
Spawns a child process running yt-dlp with the user-supplied live URL.
Outputs to temp/live_download.ts (or .mp4).
In the server code (server.js or server.py), add an endpoint (POST /start) that:
Receives a JSON body with liveUrl.
Calls the downloader function to begin the continuous download.
Test by supplying a known live (or test) URL and ensuring the file temp/live_download.ts grows in size.
Goal: Confirm you can continuously download a live stream to a rolling file.

Step 4: Implement File Fixation (Periodic Snapshot)
Install or confirm ffmpeg availability.
Add a “fixFile” function that:
Invokes ffmpeg to copy from temp/live_download.ts to temp/fixed_current.ts.
Overwrites the latter file, ensuring valid container headers.
In server.js, add a timer (setInterval or similar) that every X seconds calls fixFile.
Test by checking that temp/fixed_current.ts is updated frequently (e.g., every 10s).
Goal: Maintain a continuously “fixed” file that can be used by other parts of the system (transcription, clipping).

Step 5: Implement Audio Extraction & Whisper Transcription
Setup Whisper:
For Python: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
Or plan to call Whisper via CLI if using Node.
Create a function (in transcription_worker.py or a Node-based approach) that:
Invokes ffmpeg to extract audio (e.g., temp/audio_current.wav) from temp/fixed_current.ts.
Calls Whisper to produce transcripts (SRT or JSON).
Incorporate the same timer logic or a separate timer to repeatedly:
Fix the file
Extract audio
Run Whisper
Parse the resulting transcript.
Store transcripts in an array, database, or in-memory structure with timestamps.
Goal: Generate partial transcripts in near real time, capturing each new chunk’s text.

Step 6: Implement Real-Time Transcript Delivery (WebSockets)
Install or set up Socket.IO (Node) or a websocket library of choice.
In server.js, create a Socket.IO server that broadcasts events like transcript_update.
Whenever new transcripts are generated:
Emit them to the connected clients.
In the front-end (frontend/main.js), connect to the socket and listen for transcript_update:
Append new lines to an on-screen transcript section.
Goal: Display partial transcripts in real time as the stream is processed.

Step 7: Create the Front-End UI
In index.html, build a simple layout:
An input field for liveUrl
A “Start” button that does a POST /start fetch
A <div> or <textarea> to display transcripts streaming in.
Fields/buttons to enter or select clipping timestamps.
In main.js, add logic for:
Handling the “Start” button click (fetch to /start).
Receiving transcript_update from Socket.IO and appending text to the DOM.
Handling the clip button click (later steps).
Goal: Provide a minimal yet functional front-end to view and interact with the transcript.

Step 8: Implement Clipping Service
Create a “createClip” function that:
Receives a start time and end time.
Runs an ffmpeg command on the latest temp/fixed_current.ts (or older segments if needed) to produce a short clip (e.g., temp/clip_<timestamp>.mp4).
Add a POST /clip endpoint that:
Accepts JSON with { "start": number, "end": number }.
Calls createClip.
Returns the path or URL of the resulting clip.
In the front-end, wire up the clip button so that it:
Sends start and end to /clip.
Displays a download link or success message once the clip is created.
Goal: Let users highlight interesting times in the transcript and get a video clip instantly.

Step 9: Integrate Timestamp Selection in the Transcript UI
Enhance the transcript UI to:
Display each transcript segment with a known startSec and endSec.
Let the user select or “highlight” certain lines.
Auto-populate the clip’s start/end time fields based on the selected text.
Connect that UI to the clip button, so the user can quickly clip the exact segment.
Goal: Smooth user experience for selecting transcript-based clip times.

Step 10: Testing, Polishing, and Edge Cases
Test with an actual YouTube live event or a long VOD.
Verify that the pipeline updates transcripts in near real time.
Try clipping at various points (including near the end of the downloaded content).
Consider:
Overlapping timestamps
Frequent vs. infrequent chunk intervals
Language detection
CPU/GPU load with Whisper
Refine performance parameters (snapshot frequency, chunk size, etc.) as needed.
Goal: Ensure everything runs smoothly in real-world conditions and that you can handle potential pitfalls (stream interruptions, repeated segments, etc.).

Below is a high-level explanation of the “file fixation” strategy and how to apply it so that your real-time transcription and clipping can work properly:
Start the Continuous Download
• Use yt-dlp (or another tool) to continuously fetch the live stream into a growing file, for example “live_download.ts.”
• This file keeps getting bigger as the live stream continues.
Periodically Create a Fixed Copy
• Every few seconds (e.g., via setInterval in Node or a cron-like loop in Python), run an ffmpeg copy command that reads “live_download.ts” and writes out “fixed_current.ts.”
• Example command:
• This step ensures “fixed_current.ts” has valid container metadata. A continuously growing .ts file isn’t always valid or seekable until you rewrite the headers. By rewriting to a secondary file (“fixed_current.ts”), you effectively “seal” the partial content so ffmpeg or Whisper can process it without errors.
Use the Fixed File for Transcription
• Your transcription module repeatedly looks at “fixed_current.ts.”
• If the file size is large enough, or if enough time has passed since the last transcription, you run:
1) ffmpeg to extract audio (for example, “current_segment.wav”) from “fixed_current.ts.”
2) Whisper (or another STT tool) on that audio to get partial transcripts.
• You can overlay these transcripts on a timeline or accumulate them in a data structure. As “fixed_current.ts” grows, you discover new segments and produce more transcripts.
Use the Fixed File for Clipping
• When a user requests a clip from a known time range (say, from second 30 to second 45), you can run an ffmpeg command that trims from “fixed_current.ts” (since it’s valid and seekable).
• For example:
• This produces a clean clip that can be shared or downloaded immediately—even while the main file is still downloading in the background.
Repeat While Live
• The download to “live_download.ts” continues. Meanwhile, every few seconds:
1) You update “fixed_current.ts” from “live_download.ts.”
2) You run or schedule transcription on the updated “fixed_current.ts.”
3) You allow user clipping requests to operate against “fixed_current.ts.”
That’s the essence of the “copy-fix-treat” cycle. By sealing partial data into “fixed_current.ts,” tools like ffmpeg and Whisper can reliably read it for real-time transcription and clipping, even while the larger download is ongoing.
